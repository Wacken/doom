<p><span id="more-123078"></span></p>
<p>In late 2023, the studio announced it was pushing its “final content update” to the game with the <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/vertigo-2-bottomless-update-steamvr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bottomless Update</a>, bringing a level editor, modifiers, and new playable characters, extending the game well beyond the 10+ hour campaign.</p>
<p>Still, the final update wasn&#8217;t really <em>final. </em>In December 2024, Tsiakalis-Brown announced the award-winning shooter-adventure was getting its first paid DLC, Into the Aether.</p>
<p>Initially slated to arrive in March, Into the Aether was subsequently delayed to April with no specific timing on release. However now, Tsiakalis-Brown says it&#8217;s coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/843390/Vertigo_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam version of the game</a> on April 25th, priced at $10.</p>

<p>&#8220;Embark on an interdimensional expedition to the oldest and most mysterious universe, discover new weapons and tools, and defeat fearsome new enemies,&#8221; Tsiakalis-Brown says in the<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3305800/Vertigo_2_Into_the_Aether/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> DLC&#8217;s Steam description</a>.</p>
<p>In Into the Aether, you&#8217;ll claim artifacts of the Void to increase your strength and unlock new paths to explore. You&#8217;ll get the &#8216;Void Grappler&#8217; for &#8220;the ultimate movement upgrade,&#8221; allowing you to attach to most surfaces and swing around like Spider-Man. There&#8217;s also the &#8216;Void Deflector&#8217; as a new defensive option, allowing you to deflect attacks with precise timing, accumulating energy for a counterattack.</p>
<p>There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any active plans of bringing Into the Aether to the PSVR 2 version of the game, which was ported to PS5 by XR veterans <a href="https://perpgames.com/game/playstation-vr2-vertigo-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perp Games</a>. Perp hasn&#8217;t publicly mentioned whether it&#8217;s been contracted to bring &#8216;Into the Aether&#8217; to PSVR 2 either, so it&#8217;s shaping up to be a PC VR exclusive.</p>

<p>The studio&#8217;s breakout title <em>Job Simulator</em> <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/ces-2020-job-simulator-1-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went platinum in early 2020</a>, owing not only to its fun and approachable gameplay, but also for having been a launch title for HTC Vive, PSVR, and Oculus Touch in 2016.</p>
<p>A testament to the staying power of <em>Job Simulator</em>: it&#8217;s still on all major VR headsets, including new entrants such as Quest 3, PSVR 2, and Pico headsets. Since it initially went platinum in 2020, the studio says <em>Job Simulator</em> is now &#8220;multi-platinum&#8221;.</p>

<p>Building on that success, <em>Vacation Simulator </em>continues the original&#8217;s mad cap, object-oriented gameplay, this time letting players explore idyllic virtual destinations while taking on a variety of activities—of course viewed through the same distorted lens of a robot society in the future who have crudely reconstructed what the human-populated past must have looked like.</p>

<p>Founded in 2010 and acquired by Google in 2017, Owlchemy Labs is also behind the Emmy-nominated <em>Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality (2017) </em>and their latest VR title <em>Cosmonious High (2022), </em>which includes more of the object-oriented fun of both <em>Job &amp; Vacation Simulator, </em>but also <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/cosmonious-high-interactive-characters-procedural-system-owlchemy-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasizes </a>realistic character behavior.</p>
<p>To celebrate the news of now having multiple platinum-selling games, Owlchemy Labs launched updates to both <em>Vacation Simulator</em> and <em>Cosmonious High</em> for Quest 3, bringing enhanced visuals, such as real-time shadows and increased frame rate of 90fps.</p>

<p><span id="more-115247"></span></p>
<p>Filed in August and later entered into registry in November, the Samsung Glasses trademark specifies that it covers &#8220;Virtual reality headsets; Augmented reality headsets; Headphones; Smartphones; Smart glasses.&#8221; The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/samsung-glasses-trademark-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>UploadVR</em></a>.</p>
<p>Samsung announced in February it was <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/samsung-google-qualcomm-xr-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">partnering with Google and Qualcomm</a> to develop an XR device, something the company said at the time was “not too far away.” We&#8217;re still not sure what it will be other than hardware made by Samsung, software by Google, and chipset by Qualcomm.</p>
<p>While unconfirmed as a related device, only a short month later Samsung filed for the US trademark<a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/samsung-galaxy-ar-glasses-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> &#8216;Samsung Galaxy Glasses&#8217;</a>. In its description, the US filing is said to cover the same categories as the UK trademark.</p>
<p>Granted, this is a pretty wide range of devices which span the entire XR gamut, although both proposed &#8216;Glasses&#8217; monikers seem to imply it wouldn&#8217;t be a direct competitor to either <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Quest 3</a> or the soon-to-release <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/apple-vision-pro-xr-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple Vision Pro</a>, the $3,500 mixed reality headset which is set to launch sometime early next year.</p>

<p>Vision Pro is well beyond the size of spectacles, so calling anything with that format would be an odd move. There are a few candidates though.</p>
<p>Something similar to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/new-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta&#8217;s Smart Glasses from Ray-Ban</a> could be more fitting to bear the &#8216;Samsung Glasses&#8217; name. Confusingly enough, Meta Smart Glasses don&#8217;t have a display, instead packing in cameras, off-ear headphones, microphones, and voice access to Meta&#8217;s digital assistant.</p>

<p>Another option might be a device similar to <a href="https://www.xreal.com/air2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XREAL&#8217;s Air 2 Pro</a>, which packs in birdbath optics and micro-OLEDs for traditional content consumption, such as film, TV, and flatscreen video games.</p>
<p>A full-blown pair of all-day AR glasses is decidedly out of the picture though, as optics and battery technology (among other things) still aren&#8217;t at a point where they&#8217;d fit into a glasses format. These are problems that every major tech company in the XR space is working on currently, but it&#8217;s safe to say we&#8217;re years away from what many hope will be the next major computing platform.</p>

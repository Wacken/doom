Now the game is finally set to come to PSVR 2 next month.</p>

<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p><strong>Update (November 22nd, 2023)</strong>: Vertigo 2 has its updated release date for PSVR 2, now coming to the PlayStation Store on December 12th, 2023. A physical edition is also set to launch on February 9th, 2024.</p>
<p>This follows the studio&#8217;s &#8220;final content update&#8221; to the game, called <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/vertigo-2-bottomless-update-steamvr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bottomless Update</a>. The update brings a level editor, modifiers, and new playable characters to the game, aiming to extend it well beyond the game&#8217;s 10+ hour campaign.</p>
<p>The original article follows below:</p></blockquote>

<p><em><strong>Original Article (April 25th, 2023)</strong></em>: Reacting to Twitter user Timo Schmidt, Tsiakalis-Brown confirmed that <a href="https://twitter.com/MrZulubo/status/1649067833865674753" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSVR 2 support is still on the horizon</a>, as he recalls an earlier tweet from January saying he &#8220;would love to port to psvr in the future. It’s definitely a possibility!&#8221; (see update)</p>
<p>As many have noted in the recent past, PlayStation 5&#8217;s rendering ability is pretty much on par with a mid-range PC, which has allowed for a big bump in graphics over legacy hardware, such as PS4/PS4 Pro.</p>
<p>That bump lets developers create even more immersive and graphically intense games than we&#8217;ve ever seen on PS platform, like<a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-psvr-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain (2023),</em> </a>or the remastered version of <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/song-smoke-psvr-2-remaster-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Song in the Smoke</em></a>, the latter of which rivals even the PC VR version of the game.</p>

<p>Still, developing for PSVR 2 isn&#8217;t so cut and dry. Outside of actually getting it to work on Sony&#8217;s latest VR headset, which is a much more precise target than creating a PC VR game in general, Tsiakalis-Brown admits he&#8217;s never gone through the certification process to publish a game on the PlayStation Store. Up until now, all of the developer&#8217;s games have been PC VR only.</p>
<p>Nathan Rowe, the solo dev behind VR art app <em>SculptrVR (2016), </em>had some sage advice to overcoming the process:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">It is possible to do solo. It nearly killed me, though. My advice is to ask Sony for help early. File tickets! They get read and responded to!</p>
<p>&mdash; Nathan Rowe (@SculptrVR) <a href="https://twitter.com/SculptrVR/status/1616922078715826179?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2023</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>And what good is <em>Vertigo 2</em> without <em>Vertigo Remastered (2020)</em>? Tsiakalis-Brown says releasing both games for PSVR 2 would be a &#8220;great way to expose [the series to] a bigger audience!&#8221;</p>
<p>While the solo dev hasn&#8217;t published a post-launch release schedule, the order of operations is fairly clear. First the game&#8217;s <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/vertigo-2-level-editor-steam-dlc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming sandbox DLC</a>, which will allow users to create and share their own content based on <em>Vertigo 2</em> assets and worlds, then &#8230; who knows!</p>

Now, the studio revealed <em>Red Flowers</em> is making a major pivot to ostensibly appeal to younger users.</p>
<p><span id="more-123180"></span></p>
<p>Now called <em>Catana: Red Flowers</em><em>, </em>the game has done away with the the impossibly high city buildings and gritty aesthetic, instead offering up a decidedly more family-friendly vibe, replete with a kitty protagonist and wise (and accident prone) Grandpa Kenji to help you along the way.</p>

<p>Targeting a 2025 release on Quest and PSVR 2, <em>Catana: Red Flowers </em>lets you take on the role of a nimble ninja cat, letting you dash through enemies, deflect bullets, swing around, and wield a katana. Between levels, the game also offers up a cozy garden where you can sharpen your blade, play with Grandpa Kenji, &#8220;or just be a silly cat,&#8221; the studio says.</p>
<p>From the trailer, there&#8217;s still a good slice of bloody katana deaths, although Joy Way notes this can be toggled off in the settings, replacing it with a burst of flowers. While movement mechanics and enemies aren&#8217;t entirely a far cry from the 2022 demo (seen below), the art and level design marks a clear departure from the grittiness of the original.</p>

<p>Joy Way says that although its demo of <em>Red Flowers</em> garnered over 500k installs following its release on Quest&#8217;s now-defunct App Lab, &#8220;extensive player interviews and [&#8230;] valuable feedback&#8221; led the studio to &#8220;fully reimagine and evolve the concept.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the studio hasn&#8217;t said as much, the pivot comes amid a wider shift in the Quest player base, principally driven by the entrance of Quest 3S, Meta&#8217;s latest $300 mixed reality headset.</p>

<p>Meta noted in early 2025 that a wave of <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-quest-free-to-play-userbase-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">younger players was not only boosting free-to-play content</a> on the platform, but also paid premium content, which Meta noted at the time included games like <em>I AM CAT (2024)</em> and <em>Five Nights at Freddy’s: Help Wanted 2 (2024).</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no release date for <em>Catana: Red Flowers</em> yet beyond &#8220;later this year,&#8221; although you can now wishlist the game <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/catana-red-flowers/8996571250452624/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Horizon Store</a> for Quest 2 and above, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10014711/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation Store</a> for PSVR 2.</p>

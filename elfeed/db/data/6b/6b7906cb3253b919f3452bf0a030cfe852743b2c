Now the studio says it&#8217;s delaying release on Quest again, now targeting launch sometime in the second half of 2024.<span id="more-112497"></span></p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p><strong>Update (November 28th, 2023)</strong>: First slated to arrive on Quest in Summer 2023, it seems Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable is delayed again, moving from its revised Winter 2023 launch date now to what UNIVRS says will be the &#8220;latter half of 2024.&#8221; The game is targeting Quest 2, 3 and Pro.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the full statement from UNIVRS CEO Keigo Fujikawa:</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">“We have decided to postpone the release date of Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable once again. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to those who have been looking forward to the game as well as to everyone involved. To deliver the highest quality product to players around the world, we need a little more time to complete it. All of us at UNIVRS will continue to work hard to bring you a VR title that you will enjoy even more. We are striving to make Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable more exciting for all of you who are waiting for it, and we appreciate your continued patience.”</p>
<p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The original article detailing the first delay follows below:</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Original Article (June 1st, 2023)</strong></em>: The studio showed off a pretty slick trailer which includes pre-rendered animations, but no actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Still, much of the rope-swinging action seen in the video, courtesy of the franchise&#8217;s iconic omni-directional mobility gear, is undoubtedly doable from a VR locomotion standpoint considering we&#8217;ve seen the same movement scheme across a number of VR games, such as <em>Windlands, Yupitergrad, </em>and <em>Jet Island </em>to name a few. It&#8217;s possible much of the action seen here could translate directly to gameplay, save a bunch of the smooth lighting effects.</p>

<p>UNIVRS says <em>Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable</em> is set to feature both single player and co-op modes, and will be available in both Japanese and English, dubbed and subbed.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how the studio describes the action:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>In Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable, players are tasked with taking on unique missions as members of the Scout Regiment. They will need to combine entirely free three-dimensional movement through use of their Omni-directional Mobility (ODM) Gear with cross-range combat in order to defend themselves against killer titans. As players progress, the battle difficulty will increase, so only those with determination and skills critical to making it through to the final battle will survive.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Attack on Titan VR: Unbreakable</em> is coming to Quest 2 and Quest Pro. It&#8217;s uncertain whether it&#8217;s also targeting other headsets at this time, such as PSVR 2 or SteamVR headsets.</p>

<p><span id="more-115345"></span></p>
<p>In the new VR mode, you can tackle the game&#8217;s main story, which pits you against crazed villagers, huge creatures (some may say even <em>Gigant</em>ic), and other epic boss battles. Yes, that means you&#8217;ll be able to upgrade and blast away with all of the weapons from the main story.</p>
<p>While the PSVR 2 mode will be free to players of the game, the studio also announced it&#8217;s putting out a free demo at launch, which lets you experience the start of the game as well as try out the shooting range so you can get a taste for how each weapon shoots in VR.</p>

<p>What&#8217;s more, the game&#8217;s VR implementation was done by the same development team behind the full-length VR experiences of <em>Resident Evil 7 biohazard</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village—</em>two extremely well-done VR modes in their own right.</p>
<p>And just to avoid confusion: the VR mode coming exclusively to PSVR 2 on December 8th however isn&#8217;t the same as the <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/resident-evil-4-quest-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quest-exclusive refresh of <em>Resident Evil 4 (2021)</em></a>, which was remastered from the 2005 original by Armature Studio using new textures and including its own self-developed, VR-native controls.</p>

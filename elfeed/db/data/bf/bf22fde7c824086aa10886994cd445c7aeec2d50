<p><a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/the-room-vr-a-dark-matter/2124523024270629/"><em>Ghost Town</em> is now available on Quest 2 and Quest 3 headsets</a>, and is planned to launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">PC VR</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010082">PSVR 2</a> later this year. The game is a departure from the studio&#8217;s long-running <em>The Room</em> series, but continues its focus on puzzle and narrative gameplay.</p>

<p>Although the game is based on a foundation of the supernatural, the studio stops short of calling it a &#8216;horror&#8217; game. Rather, it emphasizes suspense and mystery as the backdrop to its puzzles.</p>
<p>The studio says <em>Ghost Town</em> has been in development for nearly four years, and represents a &#8220;significant step up for Fireproof Games in every way,&#8221; including a cast of fully motion captured characters.</p>
<p>The game is already receiving high praise for its visual fidelity, even on Quest headsets, with a setting that takes players to 1980s london.</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no specific released date for <em>Ghost Town</em> on PC VR and PSVR 2 just yet, the game is <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/the-room-vr-a-dark-matter/2124523024270629/">available now on Quest 2, Quest 3, and Quest 3S priced at $30</a>.</p>

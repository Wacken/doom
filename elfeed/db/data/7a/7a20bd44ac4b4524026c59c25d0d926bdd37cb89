Mark your calendars, because on May 30th, you&#8217;ll be able to jump into the deep end on PC VR headsets.</p>
<p><span id="more-123086"></span></p>
<p>Unlike other horror-themed walking sims, <em>Pools</em> isn&#8217;t about running from monsters or solving deadly puzzles. It&#8217;s just <em>pools, </em>and creepy ones at that.</p>
<p>Arriving as a free update to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2663530/POOLS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the PC game</a> on May 30th, the VR version will let you play the entire game from start to finish, including the recently released &#8216;Chapter 0&#8217; update, which landed on April 21st, bringing a whole new level to the game.</p>

<p>Upcoming PC VR support will be a free addition to the game on Steam; the PS5 version of the game will also get PSVR 2 support &#8220;later this year,&#8217; Tensori says in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2663530/view/507326244048601604?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent Steam update</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can currently<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2663530/POOLS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> grab <em>Pools</em> over on Steam</a> at a discount, available from now until April 27th at $6.36, or 35% off the regular $9.79 price. There&#8217;s also a free demo available, although it hasn&#8217;t been confirmed yet whether it will also come along with VR support when it launches on May 30th.</p>

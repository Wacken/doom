<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p><em><strong>Update (November 21st, 2023)</strong></em>: <em>FNAF: Help Wanted 2 </em>is officially coming to PSVR 2 on December 14th. According to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/11/20/five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-2-seeks-new-employees-december-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS blogpost</a>, six categories of minigames are coming to the game: Backstage, Fazcade, Staff Only, Food Prep, Ticket Booth, and a &#8220;special category containing new VR versions of Five Nights at Freddy’s: Sister Location gameplay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ensuring that Help Wanted 2 would be fun on every single replay was our primary goal. We developed many of the games so they’d be different each time you played, and we accomplished this by building an extraordinary amount of possibilities the player can be presented with,&#8221; said Ray McCaffrey Executive Producer, Steel Wool Studios. &#8220;Between taking customer orders, doing arts and crafts, or helping out the maintenance staff, (and plenty of other games), the player is faced with new requirements each time, keeping the challenge fresh and fun. That said, more than a few of the games have the spirit of the original Help Wanted and take players through the more curated experiences we love crafting.&#8221;</p>
<p>The studio also included a fresh gameplay trailer, which we&#8217;ve linked above and below. The original article announcing <em>FNAF: Help Wanted 2 follows below:</em></p></blockquote>

<p><em><strong>Original Article (May 24th, 2023)</strong></em>: <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-2-hiring-again-on-ps-vr2/">Developer Steel Wool Studios says</a> that <em>FNAF: Help Wanted 2 </em>will bring new mini-games and feature familiar characters and locations from the series, while breaking new ground as well.</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>Help Wanted 2 will feel familiar to players who experienced the first game, but with all new games, locations, story, and animatronics. Do your best to complete your work as fast and as diligently as you can, but be careful. One wrong move at this job can lead to… unexpected consequences. Utilizing the enhanced power and fidelity of PS VR2, this title will be the most immersive, heart-racing Five Nights at Freddy’s title ever. PS VR2 sense controller and headset haptics let players feel every step, rumble, and shake as you race to complete your tasks on time. VR brings players even closer to the animatronics than ever before, just not too close, they have been known to bite.</p></blockquote>
<p>The original <em>FNAF: Help Wanted</em> is available on the original PSVR, Quest, and PC VR, and while the studio hasn&#8217;t confirmed that the sequel will reach all the same platforms, we&#8217;d guess that&#8217;s where things are headed (except probably not the original PSVR now that Sony has moved on to PSVR 2).</p>
<p>The <em>FNAF: Help Wanted 2</em> release date is planned for &#8220;late 2023.&#8221;</p>

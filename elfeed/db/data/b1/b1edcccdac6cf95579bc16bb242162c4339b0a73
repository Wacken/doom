And before the company has even released Dream Air, Pimax revealed it&#8217;s also producing a cheaper version: Dream Air SE.</p>
<p><span id="more-123282"></span></p>
<p>Previously expected to release in May, the company announced during its Pimax Connect event that Dream Air has been delayed to August-September 2025, as the company says it&#8217;s waiting on high-end Sony micro-OLED panels, 3,840 × 3,552 per-eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sony&#8217;s micro-OLED panels are top-tier, also used by Apple and Google,&#8221; says Pimax European Marketing Director Martin Lammi. &#8220;They have an excellent quality consistency across all panels and their visual effect is better. This is because the brightness is higher and the pixels have a wider view angle or &#8216;chief ray angle&#8217;, up from 15 degrees to 20 degrees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Other updates to Dream Air include a more balanced split-cable design, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/pimax-shares-development-updates-on-dream-air-and-crystal-super-headsets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which was revealed in March</a>, as well as an optional flip-up style halo headstrap, and support for third-party head straps, such as HTC&#8217;s Deluxe Audio Strap.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Pimax revealed <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air-se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dream Air SE</a>, which includes many of the same features of Dream Air, including micro-OLED panels, integrated audio, self-adjusting strap, pancake lenses, hand-tracking, and Tobii eye-tracking. The standout difference though is Dream Air SE&#8217;s 2,560 × 2,560 resolution micro-OLEDs and lower price.</p>

<p>Dream Air SE starts at $899 for the Lighthouse version, appealing to those with existing SteamVR base stations and controllers. The SLAM version, priced at $1,199, includes controllers and inside-out tracking. You can find them both available for pre-order <a href="https://pimax.com/products/pimax-dream-air-se" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Pimax&#8217;s website</a>.</p>
<p>Like Pimax&#8217;s other headsets, users pay an upfront cost for the headset which comes with a 14-day trial period. Afterwards, if users want to keep the headset, they then pay a Pimax Prime software membership for continued access. Here&#8217;s how that breaks down:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dream Air SE &#8211; SLAM Version</strong>: $699 upfront + $500 Prime = $1,199 total</li>
<li><strong>Dream Air SE &#8211; Lighthouse Version (no controllers or basestation)</strong>: $599 upfront + $300 Prime = $899 total</li>
</ul>

<p>For comparison, Dream Air Lighthouse version starts at $1,899 ($1,199 upfront + $700 Prime), with the Dream Air SLAM version priced at $2,199 ($1,399 upfront + $800 Prime).</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Slender: The Arrival VR</em> aims to be the definitive survival horror experience. To meet this high standard for our launch, we&#8217;ve made the difficult decision to slightly delay the game&#8217;s release,&#8221; said Rob Edwards, CEO of Perp Games. &#8220;We are aiming to avoid any lengthy slippages as we understand that fans of this iconic figure in horror folklore are excited to play the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>The VR version is set to be an &#8220;official re-imagining and expansion of the original game,&#8221; which notably features a new storyline and characters, as well as improved visuals.</p>

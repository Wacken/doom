<p><span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out">Insomniac Games&#8217; VR titles have been delisted periodically over the years, however most recently all four of those titles were quietly removed from the Horizon PC Store in early 2025. </span></p>
<p><span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out">The exact timing isn&#8217;t clear, although it was first noticed in </span><span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out">early March 2025, which was reportedly due to Insomniac missing an </span><span class="relative -mx-px my-[-0.2rem] rounded px-px py-[0.2rem] transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out">annual recertification process required by Meta to remain on the Store.</span></p>
<p>While <em>Edge of Nowhere</em>, <em>Feral Rights </em>and <em>Stormland </em>were re-listed in March, PvP magic dueler <em>The Unspoken </em>was still missing in action, with no clear indication when it would be re-listed in the Store. Now, Insomniac announced in <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1919769241244348730" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent X post</a> that all four of its Rift-exclusive games are back on the Store, <em>The Unspoken</em> included.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s sad to see good VR games gather dust, although much sadder to know the studio responsible for them isn&#8217;t involved any more. <em>Stormland</em>, the studios biggest and one of <em>the best</em> Rift games to date, was released just months prior to its <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/sony-acquires-insomniac-games-strategic-blow-oculus-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquisition by Sony in 2019</a>, which we thought at the time might bolster PSVR&#8217;s content library. Long story short, it didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Funded by Meta (then Oculus) prior to its handover to Sony, all of the studio&#8217;s VR games were meant to push the medium to highlight that VR could serve up the same level of fit and finish as any &#8216;AAA&#8217; game out there. And <em><a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/stormland-review-oculus-rift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stormland</a>, </em>arguably its crowning achievement in the medium, would be its last.</p>

<p>Under Sony, the studio has since shifted focus to develop major PlayStation titles such as <em>Marvel&#8217;s Spider-Man 2 (2023)</em> and the upcoming <em>Marvel&#8217;s Wolverine, </em>but no VR games to speak of.</p>
<p>Considering all of its Rift games were more than likely delisted due to certification issues, and not Insomanic or Meta arbitrarily pulling them from the Store, we&#8217;re not taking this for more than it is—i.e. a sign that Insomniac is coming back around to VR. Although we can always hope.</p>

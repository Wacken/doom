<h4>Population: One</h4>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Fl1ARKEUwc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="POPULATION: ONE | Launch Trailer | Oculus Quest &amp; Rift Platforms"></iframe></p>
<p><em>Population: One</em> is basically VR&#8217;s most successful battle royale, letting you climb, fly, shoot, and team-up with whoever dares. The free-to-play game does feature microtransactions, but only for cosmetics, which is nice. It&#8217;s still a paid game on Steam though, which makes sense considering developers BixBox VR were acquired by Meta. There is more than just battle royale though: you can play in the sandbox for custom maps and rules, team deathmatch with customizable loadouts, a 12v12 war mode, and more.</p>

<p><i>Gym Class &#8211; Basketball </i>is the solution if you&#8217;re looking to shoot some hoops and dunk like you probably can&#8217;t on a physical court. Online multiplayer lets you go head-to-head for a pretty convincing game of b-ball thanks to the game&#8217;s physics-based and full-body kinematics.</p>

<p><em>X8 </em>is the VR hero shooter you&#8217;ve been waiting for, as you descend upon battle arenas in this 5v5 all-out brawl. In addition to versatile hero abilities, you can also activate turrets, tripwires, pop smoke and more.

<p>Once a paid game, this room-scale shooter is now free-to-play, letting you take on friends, family and foes in head-to-head 1v1 dueling. Refine your loadout and jump into the action as you scramble for weapons and send a volley of hellfire at your enemies, all the while <em>Matrix </em>dodging through this innovative bullet hell meets futuristic dueling game.

<p>From the same minds that brought you the <em>I Expect You To Die</em> series comes a short mixed reality mini-mission that lets you become a secret agent in your own living room. Smuggled out of a top-secret medical facility to recover in the comfort of your home, you&#8217;re now fitted with a new ocular implant, letting you decipher puzzles, dodge dangerous threats, fight robotic hornets, and use plenty of spy gadgets. Dr. Zor has set a trap &#8211; right in your home, and it&#8217;s up to you to thwart those plans and save the day.</p>

<p><em>Gun Raiders</em> serves up a healthy slice of multiplayer shooter action with multiple game modes that let you jetpack through the air, climb from wall to wall, and shoot down the competition.

<p><em>Hyper Dash </em>is a multiplayer shooter that basically fills in where <em>Echo Combat </em>never could (never mind that <em>Echo Combat</em> was never on Quest, and is now entirely defunct on Oculus PC). Letting you quick dash, sprint, and rail grind around, <em>Hyper Dash</em> manages to serve up an impressive number of modes, including Payload, Domination, Control Point, (Team) Deathmatch, Capture The Flag, and Elimination.

<p><i>Ultimechs </i>should look pretty familiar: it&#8217;s basically <em>Rocket League, </em>but instead of driving around in cars, you&#8217;re given rocket-powered fists to punch balls into the goal. Online multiplayer includes both 1v1 and 2v2 matches, offering up tons of opportunities to earn cosmetic gear that will let you outfit your battle mech into something unique. There are also now two paid battle passes too, offering up a ton of cosmetics to set you apart from the competition.</p>

<p><em>Battle Talent </em>is one of those fighting sims that let you go ham on ragdoll baddies, which in this case are wily goblins and loads of skelingtons. This physics-based roguelite action game lets you climb, run and slide your way through levels as you slash, shoot, and wield magic against your foes.</p>

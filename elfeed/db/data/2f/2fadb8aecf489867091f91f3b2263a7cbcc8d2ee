<h3>What Didn&#8217;t Make it in 2023</h3>
<p>While that&#8217;s a solid lineup before the end of the year, two big Quest games that we hoped to see this year won&#8217;t be out before the New Year.</p>

<p>First is the highly anticipated <em>Behemoth</em> from Skydance Interactive, the developer behind the <em>Walking Dead</em> VR games. Original slated for a 2023 release date, the studio recently announced a major delay for the game until 2024. Also coming to PSVR 2 and PC VR.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/6565887093433499/"><em>Bulletstorm VR</em></a> which was supposed to launch on December 14th, but got a last minute delay until January 18th. It&#8217;s also coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008677/">PSVR 2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2451320/Bulletstorm_VR/">PC VR.</a></p>

<p>And last but not least is <em>GTA: San Andreas VR</em>. Announced way back in 2021, we figured the game would be set for release not later than the launch of Quest 3&#8230; but with no release date set, it&#8217;s almost certainly not going to land in 2023. And with <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-update-gta-san-andreas-vr-quest-3/">no recent updates on the game</a>, we might not ever see it.</p>

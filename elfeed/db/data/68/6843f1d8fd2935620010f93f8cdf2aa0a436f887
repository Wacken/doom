<p><span id="more-115316"></span></p>
<p>The funding round was led by Taiwania Capital, a venture capital firm based in Taipei, Taiwan. Returning investors include Czechia-based Nation 1, which has increased its share by $500,000 since the previous investment round.</p>
<p>Founded in 2017 and based in Delaware, United States and Prague, Czechia, Vrgineers is slated to use the funds to accelerate growth in addition to releasing a new version of its XTAL headset later this year.</p>

<p>Priced in the thousands of dollars, the XTAL platform is designed to appeal to enterprise, with the team putting a large emphasis on flight simulation. It offers both a &#8216;pure&#8217; VR XTAL headset as well as mixed reality XTAL headsets for applications where users need to read real-world instrumentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;This investment is not just about the necessary funds to boost our activities and products, but it also brings a great deal of overlap,&#8221; Vrgineers CEO Marek Polcak said. &#8220;This strategic investment has connected us with the leaders in the electronics development and manufacturing industry. With this connection, we can now improve our technology to the highest level possible.”</p>

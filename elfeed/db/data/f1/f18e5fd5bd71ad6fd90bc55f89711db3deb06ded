<p><span id="more-115353"></span></p>
<p>Oculus Link / Air Link has for years allowed any Quest headset to connect to a PC to play PC VR content, but it requires users to install and use the long-outdated Oculus PC software. In many cases, that ends up just being a bothersome extra step to finally ending up at SteamVR which has a much more active library of VR apps and users.</p>
<p>To streamline this process, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3823053915991825336">Valve today released the <em>Steam Link</em> app</a> on the main Quest store (which means it has been given Meta&#8217;s official blessing). Using <em>Steam Link</em>, the app makes it dead simple to connect Quest directly to SteamVR without the Oculus PC software as a middle layer.</p>

<p>All you need to do is have a capable PC running Steam on the same network as your headset. Then launch the <a href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/5841245619310585/"><em>Steam Link</em> app</a> in your Quest and you&#8217;ll be greeted with a pairing code. Enter the code on your PC and&#8230; voila, you&#8217;re looking at your SteamVR library.</p>
<p>And it isn&#8217;t just PC VR gamesâ€”you can also play any game from your Steam library on a big screen in front of you. Again, this has all been possible before, but <em>Steam Link</em> makes the process easier than ever.</p>

<p>To use <em>Steam Link</em>, Valve says the minimum requirements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wi-Fi: 5 GHz minimum, wired connection to PC</li>
<li>GPUs: NVIDIA (GTX970 or better)</li>
<li>OS: Windows 10 or newer</li>
<li>Headset: Meta Quest 2, 3, or Pro</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s indications that <em>Steam Link</em> on Quest may also support eye-tracking and face-tracking for those using Oculus Pro, but we haven&#8217;t had a chancre to test it just yet.</p>

Now the studios say it&#8217;s launching a few weeks later than originally planned, pushing release into January.</p>
<p><span id="more-112529"></span></p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p><strong>Update (November 20th, 2023)</strong>: <em>Bulletstorm</em> was set to arrive on PSVR 2, Meta Quest, and PCVR headsets on December 14th, however developers People Can Fly and Incuvo <a href="https://twitter.com/Bulletstorm/status/1726640186996789449" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced via X</a> (formerly Twitter) that the VR game is experiencing a brief delay that will push it to January 18th, 2024.</p>
<p>&#8220;We know that Bulletstorm fans are eager to put on their VR headsets and kick ass in virtual reality,&#8221; the studios say. &#8220;We aim to use this extra time to continue improving the experience to ensure that Bulletstorm VR lives up to the high standards you&#8217;ve come to expect from the well-known AAA FPS franchise and People Can Fly as a developer of high-quality AAA games.</p>
<p>The original article announcing Bulletstorm VR follows below:</p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Original Article (June 1st, 2023)</strong></em>: The game is currently under development by Incuvo, known for <em>Green Hell VR</em>, and the game&#8217;s original developers People Can Fly.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t played the original, or the remastered version <em>Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition (2017)</em> on flatscreen, <em>Bulletstorm</em> sets itself apart from other shooters by emphasizing skill points, which you earn by creatively dispatching the enemy.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how Incuvo describes the VR version:</p>
<blockquote class="td_quote_box td_box_center"><p>Back in 2011, Bulletstorm introduced the world to the “Skillshot.” Kick an enemy into a cactus? Skillshot. Crush one under a hot dog cart? Skillshot. Grab one with your Energy Leash and fling ‘em into a burner? Definitely a skill shot. Today, People Can Fly and Incuvo (developer of Green Hell VR) announced they’re bringing Bulletstorm to the Meta Quest Store. Skillshots new and old, as well as the action-packed story—all of it recreated from the ground up to take advantage of VR.</p></blockquote>
<p>Today&#8217;s announcement of the co-op shooter also arrived with a gameplay trailer, showing off the game&#8217;s skill-based carnage, fast-paced locomotion, and massive monsters.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear when we&#8217;ll see <em>Bulletstorm</em> on Quest 2, or what other platforms it might arrive on in the future (SEE UPDATE). In the meantime, take a look at the trailer below:</p>

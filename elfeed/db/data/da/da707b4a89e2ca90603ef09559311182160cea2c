<p><span id="more-123124"></span></p>
<p>Like the popular Unity and Unreal game engines, <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a> is a collection of development tools that make it easy for developers to build real-time games and applications. Unlike the other two, Godot is fully open-source, meaning anyone can use the engine and distribute games built with it free of charge. Because it&#8217;s open source, developers can also contribute features and fixes to the engine for all to use.</p>
<p>In a rare move for Apple, the company is directly adding visionOS support to Godot, making it possible for developers to build and distribute Vision Pro content with the engine.</p>
<p>Apple software engineerÂ Ricardo Sanchez-Saez recently <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pull/105628">shared the company&#8217;s plans to add visionOS support to Godot as an open-source contribution</a>. He said the feature would come in two major parts, with the first set to allow games built with Godot to run in flat windows on visionOS, and a second to add support for building fully immersive visionOS applications with the engine.</p>
<p>Because of the open-source process, it will take some time for Apple&#8217;s contributions to get rolled into the production version of Godot, and there&#8217;s no hard timeline for the completion of the project.</p>

<p>Godot will join the likes of Unity, Unreal Engine, and first-party Apple tools like X-code, and Reality Composer Pro as a way for developers to build applications for Vision Pro.</p>
<p>Godot can also be used to build apps for major VR platforms like Quest and PC VR.</p>

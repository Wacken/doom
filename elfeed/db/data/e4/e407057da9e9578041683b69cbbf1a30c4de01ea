<p>Released back in 2021, <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/varjo-aero-review-vr-simmers-vr/">Varjo Aero is the company&#8217;s first and only prosumer-positioned headset</a>. Though high-end, it has also been a lesser-speced headset than the company&#8217;s flagship devices.</p>

While the headset&#8217;s $4,000 price tag is surely targeting high-end enterprise use-cases, for the handful of prosumers out there who have cash to burn, XR-4 is actually the cheapest of the company&#8217;s enterprise-positioned headsets yet. It&#8217;s also the first of Varjo&#8217;s XR-series headsets that the company will sell directly to consumers and without a required annual fee.</p>
<p>For now the company is <a href="https://varjo.com/company-news/xr-4-waitlist/">soliciting invitations to join the consumer waitlist for the XR-4</a>, saying those on the list will be alerted when the headset is available in their given country.</p>

<p>While XR-4 has its own inside-out tracking system, the company is also making a variant of the headset which ties it into the SteamVR Tracking ecosystem (as its prior headsets once relied upon).</p>
<p>Unfortunately it&#8217;ll bring the price of the base variant of the headset up by another $1,000. Varjo has confirmed that this variant of XR-4 can switch back and forth between SteamVR Tracking and the headset&#8217;s own inside-out tracking.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s potentially also possible to eschew the $1,000 addition and instead add SteamVR Tracking to the base variant of XR-4 by attaching something like the <a href="https://tundra-labs.com/">Tundra Tracker</a> and configuring it to represent the position of the headset. Though this will take a few extra steps compared to having SteamVR Tracking built right in.</p>

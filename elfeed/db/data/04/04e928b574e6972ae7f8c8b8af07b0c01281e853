<p>We’re thrilled to announce that our VR game <strong><a href="https://geni.us/ahylYNB"><em>The ChicKing Dead</em> is officially available in Early Access on the Meta Oculus Store</a></strong>! As a South Korea-based studio, Quantum Universe has poured years of XR development experience into creating this Free-to-Play VR multiplayer experience that fuses arm-based locomotion with tag-style chaos.</p>
<h4>Who We Are – Q GAMES</h4>
<p>We are <strong>Quantum Universe</strong>, a VR game development studio headquartered in Seoul, South Korea. Our team brings extensive experience across XR technologies—including VR, AR, and MR—from a wide range of past projects. <em>The ChicKing Dead</em> is our first flagship title, designed to blend fun, movement, and madness into one unforgettable VR experience.</p>
<h4>What Makes ‘The Chicking Dead’ Special?</h4>
<p>Our game embraces the latest VR trend—arm-based locomotion—where players use real-life arm swings to move, jump, and glide. But we’ve taken it a step further—with the ability to dash, boost, and chain movements together, you can dominate the battlefield in true chaotic style. The result? Fast-paced, fluid gameplay that’s thrilling from start to finish.</p>

<h4>Zombies vs. Chickens – Tag Meets Survival</h4>
<p>Each match begins with 9 players. One randomly becomes the Alpha Zombie, whose mission is to infect the rest—aka the Normal Chickens. Once infected, chickens switch sides and join the zombie team to hunt down remaining survivors.The round ends when all chickens are infected or time runs out. Whether you’re dodging and gliding to survive or strategically infecting others, every match is unpredictable fun.</p>
<h4>LOCOROID System – Mobility Meets Strategy</h4>
<p>One of our proudest innovations is the LocoRoid system: robotic companions that unlock powerful movement-based skills. Each LocoRoid brings unique abilities—like targeted dashes or vertical launches—that add customization and tactical depth to every round. Choose the LocoRoid that fits your playstyle and dominate the game your way.</p>

<p>The new arcade machine lets you cycle through various activities, such as new mini-games to play, which include Play Dates, Dotball (i.e. dodgeball), or an Eating Contest with you Dot. By participating in these mini-games, you can earn in-game currency, which you can then trade in at the shop for accessories for your Dot, such as outfits and playful items.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this major evolution of <em>Hello, Dot</em>, we&#8217;re not just adding new gameplay; we&#8217;re pushing deeper into the magic of true mixed reality interaction,&#8221; said Asim Ahmed, Global Product Marketing Lead, who further noted the app is &#8220;exploring how digital life can enhance our physical spaces, fuels our passion as we build towards a future where technology seamlessly weaves wonder into the fabric of our everyday reality.&#8221;</p>

<p><em>Hello, Dot</em> now also includes a new Gen AI-powered Dot customizer, letting you grab a virtual microphone and describe the look you want you Dot to have, and dunk them into a magical paint bucket for the desired effect.</p>
<p>You can find <em>Hello, Dot</em> over <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/hello-dot/25825290007070369/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Horizon Store</a> for free, which exclusively supports Quest 3 and 3S.</p>

Now, CM Games reveals it&#8217;s finally coming to Quest this month.</p>
<p><span id="more-123240"></span></p>
<p><em>Into the Radius 2</em> is headed to Quest 3 and Quest 3S in early access on May 21st, the studio announced, noting that the full 1.0 release of the game is slated to arrive sometime next year.</p>
<p>Like the original <em>Into the Radius (2020),</em> the sequel is all about roaming the wastelands of a post-apocalyptic exclusion zone where you battle against deadly ‘Pechorsk’ anomalies.</p>

<p>Real-world weapons, tactical gear, and powerful artifacts are also here, although the follow-up’s biggest feature over the original is undoubtedly the inclusion of two-person co-op, which the studio says will also support up to four players at full release.</p>
<p>Notably, CM Games says crossplay between the PC VR and Quest 3 versions of the game<a href="https://x.com/intotheradius/status/1920225979491917965" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> &#8220;is not planned.&#8221;</a></p>

<p>Still, the incentive to bring <em>Into the Radius 2</em> to VR&#8217;s biggest platform is massive. On PC VR alone, CM Games revealed earlier this year <em>Into the Radius 2</em> has already generated <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/into-the-radius-2-pc-vr-3m-revenue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly $3 million in revenue</a>. What&#8217;s more, over half of that revenue was generated in the first week alone, making for some pretty high stakes when it launches on Quest later this month.</p>
